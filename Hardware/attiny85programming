--- 

The problem is that the device permissions by default only allow root to write to the device. By using the command lsusb you can find out the bus and device id of your USBasp device:

$ lsusb
...
Bus 003 Device 018: ID 16c0:05dc Van Ooijen Technische Informatica shared ID for use with libusb
...
$ ls -al /dev/bus/usb/003/018
crw-rw-r-- 1 root root 189, 273 23. Aug 11:23 /dev/bus/usb/003/018
The quick and dirty solution is to simply change the device permissions by hand. The downside of this is that you have to repeat this procedure every time you reconnect the device.

$ sudo chmod 666 /dev/bus/usb/003/018
