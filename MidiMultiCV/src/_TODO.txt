DONE
remove live mono from mode handler
gate led per channel -> add digital out in mode handler, depends on num notes on in state 
mode input switch using voltage divider -> analogin -> N-position switch in : int selected = 1 + (1+N)*analogValue; return selected/2;

DONOTDO
mode input via switch per channel -> 2 digital ins

TODO
compile time asserts for pinnames: blue pill platform -> 
    is PWM (for analog out), 
    (is 5V tolerant (for inputs), )
    is digital input (5V tolerant, not reset, not low current), 
    is digital output (5V tolerant, not reset, not low current)
    is ADC (for analog in), 
    ...
compile time getter pinname to/from index (same convention as chips) 
compile time check/count of pin usage (??)
print pin usage upon startup / upon compilation (?? for asserted pins??)

CV midi handler voltage offet move to octave handler?
mode handler: use note stack to end all notes when changing mode
'midi panic' (i.e. all notes off) -> via dedicated function on handlers?
??? "is mono/poly" getter on handler e.g. CV, can be used by other handlers????
log CV midi after monophonic not after mode handler
